This program simulates an airport. Planes can land and take-off only when the weather is clear. 

As in life, the weather is generally good for flying but on rare occasions storms will ground all planes and prevent those that wish to land from doing so.

The plane hangar has a limited capacity and when full, any incoming planes will be redirected.

###Assumptions

On initialisation, there are no planes in the airport hangar. All new planes will land and are stored in the hangar for reference. 

###Next Steps

- DRY up the code further
